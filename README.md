# Node.js Mentorship Program

Hi, NodeJS Mentorship Team!

I'm Lucian. I am a freelance web developer. I take my work seriously and always welcome opportunities to grow and improve. One of the things I'm working on right now is growing my network and getting better at the people part of the job. And so I think joining your team would be a fantastic opportunity to do that. In exchange I can contribute my time and focus to sustainably grow contributions in the ecosystem. Let's talk more if you're interested.
